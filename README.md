# BookStore
This is the GitHub Repository for the BookStore App that out group was developing using various Agile practices. Out team consisted of 
Jeremy Grimmer, Justinn Ziegler, and Peter Kline. We first conversed over what it was that we wanted our app to do, and we converted those ideas into 
User Stories. After writing out all of our User Stories, we created created the tasks for each story, and group members to each task. We created a 
new branch on GitHub for each group member to complete their respective tasks in. Once the tasks were completed, we push our code back to the Develop 
Branch. As we rapidly progressed in our respective branches, we sought to add User Stories, we also removed some of our more nonsensical User Stories.
Once we were believed to be finished with our app, we began to make all our respecive branches have 'uniform text' and then we began to debug 
to get our API endpoints fully operatioinal.

Many of our User Stories were created as stretch goals, so we did not intend on completing them. However, as time progressed, the completion of 
our strech goals ended up being something we were able to complete.

# Code
We worked on a Web API that allowed a user to create different Authors, Books, BooksInIndividualCarts, Carts, Genres, Publishing Companies, and 
Ratings for a database. The user can enter certain properties for each of these items, and they will be stored in tables in the database. We also included foreign 
keys to link each book to a specific Author, Cart, Genre, and Publishing Company, and each of the aforementioned included a list of books inside. We created API 
endpoints that allow the user to view all of these authors, view all of the genres, view all of the publishing companies, or view specific books based on entry 
criteria. All of the necessary data will show up to the user and allow them to view specific books in whatever way they want to.

# Division of Labor
Peter was the GitMaster, so he created the GitHub Repo. We all collectively created and wrote down the User Stories, as well as the tasks for each User
Story. We worked together to decide which tasks we could complete, and we all agreed upon specific 'verbage'. In the end, Justinn completed tasks for Author
and Rating. Jeremy completed tasks for Genre. Peter completed tasks for Book, and Publishing Company. Once the foundation was completed for our API we 
reconviened, and worked to add Cart and BooksInIndividualCarts (initialially stretch goals). We all worked together to debug the Web API and make sure that 
the endpoints were working.
